Version 1.1.3
- The multi-start Nelder-Mead algorithm, used for global Gibbs energy minimization in biphasic flash, has been replaced for a much more efficient simulated anneling algorithm, with a final smoothing of the result by some loops of successive substituion.
- The minimum of the modified (without the ideal part) reduced global Gibbs energy is now displayed in order to compare the quality of the flashes.
- It is now possible to check the stability of the resulting phases from the flash calculation, in the Mixture results tab.

Version 1.1.2
- Bug correction related with forgoten link between flash calculation button and its actuation slot.

Version 1.1.1
- Bugs corrections related with SQlite connection and more than 12 substances in a mix.

Version 1.1
- Interfaced enlarged to manage 15 substances in a mixture.
- Stability check by Michelsen, and global optimizer, methodologies added.
- Two phases flash by global optimizer added.
- Mixture export to a file contains now also the composition.
- Added import of a mixture from file
- Code cleaning and bugs correction.
