Version 1.4.3
-New compilation of the Windows executable. The previous one was made with some calculations dissabled.

Version 1.4.2
- New compilation of the Windows executable, due to a problem in FreeFluidsC that was limiting the number of multiparameter EOS terms. 

Version 1.4.1
- Bug correction. It was not possible to save vapor pressure correlations using DIPPR 101

Version 1.4.0
- Small bug correction.

Version 1.3.0
- Modified exportation in Modelica Media format.
- Added management for the calculation of coefficients for the reduced bulk modulus of the liquid.
- Database modification for storing reduced bulk modulus information.
- Some bugs correction. 

Version 1.2.2
- Change in the NULL condition of some fields of the SqLite database, that were aborting the insertion of new correlations and EOS.
 This is an old bug that I had not observed till now.

Version 1.2.1
- Correction in the query of substances to obtain compatibility with SqLite

Version 1.2.0
- Added support for liquid isothermal compressibility correlation
- Added support for PPDS15 correlation equation
- Added exportation of the selected substance in a format adequate for FreeFluids.MediaCommon.MediaData.DataRecord, to be used in Modelica medium definition.
- Database enhanced to 441 substances

Version 1.1.5
- Calculation of liquid density and transport properties, with pressure correction, has been added for pure substances. The resulting data is displayed at the end of the 
 EOS results main table. If a selection has been made in the correlations tab, it is employed in the calculation. If not, it is predicted. Later a pressure 
 correction is applied.

Version 1.1.4

- A bug that was preventing the display of results of EOS calculation for pure substances in some situations has been corrected.

- An improved simulation annealing algorithm is now used for both, tangent plane and global Gibbs energy, minimization. The algorithm stores 
the best result obtained at high temperatures and performs a final loop at low temperature to improve accuracy.

- A differential evolution global Gibbs energy minimization algorithm is now available for two phases flashes.

- Several mixtures files have been stored in the 'Data' subdirectory of the Windows program. The files, with '.md' extension can be imported
 and tested. Despite not all the data are displayed after importation (for example the selected EOS for each substance), they are inside the imported structure.



Version 1.1.3

- The multi-start Nelder-Mead algorithm, used for global Gibbs energy minimization in biphasic flash, has been replaced for a much more efficient simulated 
anneling algorithm, with a final smoothing of the result by some loops of successive substituion.

- The minimum of the modified (without the ideal part) reduced global Gibbs energy is now displayed in order to compare the quality of the flashes.

- It is now possible to check the stability of the resulting phases from the flash calculation, in the Mixture results tab.



Version 1.1.2

- Bug correction related with forgoten link between flash calculation button and its actuation slot.



Version 1.1.1

- Bugs corrections related with SQlite connection and more than 12 substances in a mix.



Version 1.1

- Interface enlarged to manage 15 substances in a mixture.

- Stability check by Michelsen, and global optimizer, methodologies added.

- Two phases flash by global optimizer added.
- Mixture export to a file contains now also the composition.

- Added import of a mixture from file

- Code cleaning and bugs correction.
